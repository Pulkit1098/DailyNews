# DailyNews App

## Description
DailyNews is a simple and intuitive web application where users can browse the latest news across various categories. It fetches news articles from a News API and displays them in a clean, card-based format. Users can explore different categories such as General, Business, Entertainment, Sports, and more. Clicking on a news card redirects the user to the full article for an in-depth read.

## Features
- Fetches live news articles using the News API.
- Categorized news sections for easy navigation:
  - General
  - Business
  - Entertainment
  - Sports
  - Others (as per available categories from the API).
- News displayed in an attractive card format.
- Redirects to the full news article on click.

## Technologies Used

  .then(data => {
    // Process data here
  });
```
